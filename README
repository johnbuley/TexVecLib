TexVecLib

This library allows for the transformation of a set of documents
to a tf-idf matrix.  The matrix can then be used as input for
the calculation of a cosine similarity matrix, for instance.
The output is in the form of a 2d-array, so it is agnostic
with respect to an external linear algebra library.

term frequency(word w|doc d) = |occurrences of w in d|
inverse doc frequency(word) = log(|set of docs| / |docs in which w occurs|)
tf-idf = tf * idf

Each row corresponds to a document, and each column corresponds
to a word.

So a word that occurs in many documents will have a low score
when it occurs, and a word that occurs in few documents will
have a high score.  This can be used as a basic keyword-extraction
criterion.

Components
---------------------------------------------------------------
class TfIdfVectorizer

  public void fit(String, int, float)
  	      	
		Trains the model.
	
		String  	path to folder of documents
		int	      	min document frequency
			       	 i.e., the minimum number of documents 
			       	 in which a word must appear to be 
			       	 included in training set
		float	      	max document frequency ratio
			       	 the max document frequency expressed
			       	 as a fraction of the total number
			       	 of training documents


  public TfIdfMatrix transform(String)

 		Generates a TfIdfMatrix based on the trained
		model.

 		String  	path to folder of documents


  public TfIdfMatrix fitTransform(String, int, float)

  	 	Performs both fit and transform steps.

  	 	String  	path to folder of documents
		int	      	min document frequency
			       	 i.e., the minimum number of documents
			       	 in which a word must appear to be
			       	 included in training set
		float	      	max document frequency ratio
			       	 the max document frequency expressed
			       	 as a fraction of the toal number
			       	 of training documents

Library also offers overloaded methods for the above, accepting
DocumentSet instead of String.

  public final double[][] matrix    a tf-idf matrix


  public int indexOf(String)	    returns the column index of a word

  public String wordAt(int)	    returns the word corresponding to
  	 			    a column

  public calcIdf()		    calculate idf for all known
                                    tokens in the corpusMetadata; not
                                    dependent on valid tokens


class DocumentSet

  public enum DocumentSetType	    if FIT, then corpusMetadata unlocked
                                    if TRANSFORM, corpusMetadata locked
                                    (no new tokens)


  public void addFolder(String)	    add all text files in a folder
                                    to set

  public Iterator<SparseDoc>        returns an iterator for the doc
                  iterator()	    collection
	                            

class SparseDoc

  public void addToken(int)	    given a unique token id, add token

  public DocIterator iterator()	    returns iterator which joins elements
                                    of two byte arrays: tokenIds and
                                    tokenCounts

                                    arrays to minimum necessary


class IntArrayAsBytes

  public void set(int,int)	    set element using the abstracted
                                    index; i.e., if 1000 ints are
                                    stored in 3000 bytes, the consumer
                                    references the 1000-element index

  public void get(int)		    get element at abstract index

                                    or smaller for compression
